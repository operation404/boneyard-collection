# Boneyard Collection

The Boneyard Collection is a collection of different modules I've written to enhance my experience using FoundryVTT. I make them public on the off chance someone else happens to find them useful too.

- [Boneyard Drawing Tools](https://github.com/operation404/boneyard-drawing-tools)
- [Boneyard Template Tools](https://github.com/operation404/boneyard-template-tools)
- [Boneyard Turn Timer](https://github.com/operation404/boneyard-turn-timer)
- [Boneyard Action Prefabs](https://github.com/operation404/boneyard-action-prefabs)
- [Boneyard Socketlib Companion](https://github.com/operation404/boneyard-socketlib-companion)

Many of the various macros and world scripts I've written can be found in this repository. Many of them are for older foundry versions as once a game starts I tend to not update the Foundry version of that game any further.
